* I am a Max Weber Fellow (political science/sociology) at the European University Institute, Florence.
<br>  
* I use Shiny and R to visualize data for my research as well as to explain various methodological concepts to students.
<br>  
* Please contact me... (http://paulcbauer.eu/)
    + ...if you have feedback/comments.
    + ...if you would like to suggest additional features.
    + ...if you discover any errors or mistakes.
    + ...if you need the code.
    + ...if you are interested in some other visualizations I develop.
<br>    
* These visualizations are only possible thanks to tools developed by the people behind [R](http://www.r-project.org/contributors.html) and [RStudio](http://www.rstudio.com/about/).
